## **UnderSCORE**

**UnderSCORE** is an interactive web-based Decision Support Tool (DST) for understorey biodiversity In European Temperate forests under global change. It comprises two modules: UnderSCORE-GAM predicting regional scale understorey response to global change and UnderSCORE-GBR predicting local scale understorey response to global change. Users can 

[Visit the website](https://bingbinwen.shinyapps.io/UnderSCORE_GAM_GBR/) and follow the instructions on the Home page to use the UnderSCORE online 

Or download UnderSCORE and use it locally.  

## UnderSCORE-GAM

UnderSCORE-GAM is developed based on four regional scale understorey models using Generalized Additive Models(GAM) predicting understorey properties (i.e. species richness, total vegetation cover, proportion of woody species, proportion of forest specialists). These GAM models were developed with understorey vegetation data and regional-scale environmental data from 1814 ancient forest plots across western-central temperate Europe from [forestREplot]([https://forestreplot.ugent.be/) and [PASTFORWARD ](https://pastforward.ugent.be/)databases ([Wen, et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120465)). 

## UnderSCORE-GBR

UnderSCORE-GBR is developed based on four plot-level understorey models, using machine learning Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) and field-collected soil data, regional-scale environmental data, and understorey vegetation resurvey data from 1363 temperate forest plots across central-western Europe complied with  [forestREplot](https://forestreplot.ugent.be/) and [PASTFORWARD](https://pastforward.ugent.be/)
databases. The GBR models were developed to predict the trajectories of understorey properties (i.e. species richness, total vegetation cover, proportion of woody species, proportion of forest specialists) in response to global change and forest management ([Wen, et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2024.122091)).
